	<h2>Our History</h2>	
	<img id="history-image" src="labhead.jpg" alt="History" />
	<b>Durham House of Pets has been proudly serving Durham area pet owners for over 150 years. DHP was founded in 1867, one year after the University of New Hampshire was founded. Founder Ed Nelson II originally started running the business out of his small cottage. Once Nelson’s business took off he opened up shop on main street where the store is still located today. Nelson was known to many as the “Fish Man” due to his lifelong fascination with collecting different fish species, rumored to have owned over 73 different species of fish in his lifetime. Nelson started off selling fish, fish food and food for dogs and cats. Since then the store has stopped selling fish and evolved towards creating and selling quality pet supplies including food, leashes, collars, fish tanks and more.
